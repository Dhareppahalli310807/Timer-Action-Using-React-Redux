# React Redux Timer and Counter App

This is a simple React application that includes a timer and a counter. It uses Redux for state management and React Router for navigation between different pages.

## Features

- **Timer**: Start, pause, and reset a timer. Displays elapsed time.
- **Counter**: Increment, decrement, and reset a counter with limits. Displays the count value.
- **Alerts**: Shows alerts when timer actions are performed.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between Home, Timer, and Counter pages using a navbar.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dhareppahalli310807/Timer-Action-Using-React-Redux.git
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   npm start

## Usage
Home Page: Navigate to Timer and Counter pages.
Timer Page: Start, pause, and reset the timer. Alerts are shown for each action.
Counter Page: Increment, decrement, and reset the counter. The counter has limits (0 to 10).

# Redux
The app uses Redux for state management. The state is divided into three main slices:

Timer: Manages the timer's state, including elapsed time and running status.
Counter: Manages the counter's state, including the current count.
Alert: Manages alert messages displayed on the Timer page.
